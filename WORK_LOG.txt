// WORK IN PROGRESS: Looks like com.tazadum.glsl.optimizer.inline.FunctionInlineVisitor.remapVariables is replacing
// usage in the original function instead of in the cloned row
// Not sure if this is true. The VariableRegistry cloning fails because declarations has been added without being
// attached to the node graph

// TODO: handle inout/out parameters when inlining functions

// TODO: detect duplication
// TODO: Sharing functions between shaders, non-colliding identifiers and C-stub for concatenation
